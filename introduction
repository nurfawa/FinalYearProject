Hello, my name is Fahima. Welcome to the repository for my Final Year Project at Universiti Tenaga Nasional. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to bring my ideas to fruition through this project. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its objectives, and its relevance to the field of quantum computing and cybersecurity.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to my alma mater, Universiti Tenaga Nasional, for their support and for providing me with the resources needed to complete this project.

## Project Overview

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Grover's Algorithm on AES S-BOX Function  
**Project Type:** Research-based  
**Supervisor:** [Supervisor's Name]

### Objectives

1. Identify the strengths and vulnerabilities of existing cryptographic algorithms, establish criteria suitable for upcoming experiments, and assess potential attacks that may be exploited by Grover’s Algorithm and other advancements in quantum computing.
2. Experiment and evaluate the feasibility of quantum attacks against the AES algorithm's S-box function using Grover’s Algorithm, assessing the potential impact on cybersecurity.
3. Explore and recommend cryptographic approaches that can resist quantum attacks to enhance the resilience of cryptographic systems against emerging quantum technologies.

## Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems far more efficiently than traditional computers. This advancement poses significant risks to data security, particularly through the potential of breaking traditional encryption methods like the AES S-BOX encryption swiftly.

### Problem Statement

Currently, breaking AES S-BOX encryption with traditional computers would take an impractical amount of time—billions of years. However, quantum computers might reduce this time drastically, potentially cracking the encryption within months or years as they evolve.

### Grover's Algorithm

Grover's Algorithm is central to this research. It optimizes the search for the correct decryption key, potentially reducing the steps needed from 2^128 to 2^64 in a quantum computing context.

## Research Methodology

The project employs simulations to study the effect of Grover's Algorithm on the security of the AES S-BOX, determining the number of quantum bits (qubits) required to break the encryption and investigating new encryption methods that are more resilient to quantum attacks.

## Significance

This research aims to contribute to global efforts in preparing digital security systems for the quantum era, aligning with the 9th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): building resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation.

## Conclusion

I hope that my study will contribute significantly to the field, helping secure financial systems, communication networks, health systems, and more against the threats posed by advancements in quantum computing.
