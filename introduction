Hello. My name is Fahima and this is my Final Year Project. 

Before that, I would like to thank my alma meter, Universiti Tenaga Nasional for giving me this opportunity to make my idea comes true. 

Next, let's dive into my project. 

Firstly, I will explain about this project briefly.

Title         : Investigating the impact of Grover's algorithm on AES S-BOX function 
Project Type  : Research-based
Objectives    : 

1) Identify the strength and vulnerabilities in existing cryptographic algorithms, the suitable criteria of cryptographic algorithm that can be used
for the upcoming experiment, and possible attacks on the algorithm that may be exploited by Grover’s Algorithm and other advancements in quantum computing.
2) Experiment and evaluate the feasibility of quantum attacks against the S-box function of AES algorithm using Grover’s Algorithm and assess 
the potential impact of these attacks on cybersecurity, including the difficulty of cracking the algorithm using a quantum computer.
3) Explore and provide recommendations and cryptographic approaches that can resist quantum attacks to enhance the resilience of cryptographic systems 
in the face of emerging quantum technologies.


Basically, quantum computing is a new kind of technology that uses the rules of quantum mechanics to solve problems much faster than regular computers. 
This could be a problem for keeping data safe because quantum computers might be able to break codes that protect our private information, like the 
AES S-BOX encryption, very quickly.

Right now, breaking AES S-BOX encryption with regular computers would take billions of years, but quantum computers might be able to do it in just a few 
months or years if they become strong enough. As technology improves quickly, it's expected that quantum computers will get more powerful and cheaper, 
which could make our current security methods vulnerable.

My research project looks into how quantum computing could break AES S-BOX encryption, especially using something called Grover's algorithm. Grover's algorithm 
is a way to make searching for the right decryption key much faster. It could turn a search that would normally take 2^128 steps into just 2^64 steps using a quantum computer.

The main goal of this study is to use simulations to see how Grover's algorithm affects the security of AES S-BOX. It will also find out how many quantum bits (qubits) 
are needed to break the encryption. Besides that, the research will look for new ways to encrypt data that quantum computers can't break easily. 
This is important to help keep things like financial systems, communication networks, and health systems safe as quantum computers become more common.

I am hoping that my study can contributes to the global effort to prepare our digital security systems for the quantum era, aligning with 
the 9th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of building resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation.
