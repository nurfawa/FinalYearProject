</div>

Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics to perform computations at speeds unattainable by traditional computers. This emerging technology poses significant threats to data security, especially concerning the rapid decryption capabilities against standard encryption methods like AES S-BOX.

## Research Methodology

This study utilizes simulations to investigate Grover's Algorithm's impact on AES S-BOX security, determining the necessary quantum bits (qubits) and exploring resilient encryption methodologies.

## Significance

The findings are intended to bolster the resilience of cryptographic systems, aligning with the **9th SDG** of building resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation.

## Conclusion

This research aims to fortify protections within financial systems, communications networks, and health systems against the quantum computing threat.
